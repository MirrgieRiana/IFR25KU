This is an unofficial fork of MirageFairy2024, a Minecraft mod originally developed by The Developer of MirageFairy, Generation 7, and is now independently developed by Yoruno Kakera.

Since this mod is compatible with the original MirageFairy2024 save data, it cannot be installed simultaneously due to conflicts.
